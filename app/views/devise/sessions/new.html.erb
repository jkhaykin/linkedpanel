		      <h3>Why was this made?</h3>
		      <p class="why-made">As of now, LinkedIn has no simple way for users to follow other user updates. When users update their profiles, they can choose whether or not to share with their network. If the don't share, you won't know they updated their profile. If they do share, it gets posted to a feed and you most likely won't get an email. LinkedPanel wants to give you the power so you can choose to be updated.</p>
